# m1craft

Head on over to the [releases](https://github.com/ezfe/m1craft/releases) page to download.

Note: 1.18-pre2 and later can be run directly from the official Minecraft launcher. Follow instructions [here](https://gist.github.com/ezfe/8bc43a65e16b79c955f81b4d7fa4ae6a) if you'd prefer to do this instead. However this launcher is still my recommended method since it handles it automatically.
