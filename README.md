# Notice: With full Apple Silicon support in the default launcher, this project is not receiving full priority. As such I will not be able to guarantee any technical support or ongoing compatibility, although it is my goal to keep it working and continue improving it in the future.

# I recommend [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org) for an alternative launcher at this time

Run Minecraft 1.17, 1.18, and 1.19 without installing any profiles, json files, or jars.

This tool does **not** modify either the Minecraft JAR or LWJGL JARs. For 1.19, the LWJGL jars are provided by Mojang. For versions 1.18 and older and the LWJGL jars are pre-built 3.3.0 (3.3.1 for 22w16a and later) directly from lwjgl.org.

**Warning:** For 1.18 and earlier, do not use the Minecraft fullscreen option, instead use the system one (green button). If you've used the Minecraft one and it's crashing, follow the steps [here](https://github.com/ezfe/m1craft/issues/5#issuecomment-972287174)

Note: 1.18 and later can be run directly from the official Minecraft launcher. Follow instructions [here](https://gist.github.com/ezfe/8bc43a65e16b79c955f81b4d7fa4ae6a) if you'd prefer to do this instead â€“ including if you need to mod the game. However this launcher is still easier (no install steps needed).
