# m1craft

Run Minecraft 1.17 and 1.18 without installing any profiles, json files, or jars.

This tool does **not** modify either the Minecraft JAR or LWJGL JARs. The Minecraft JAR is downloaded unmodified from Minecraft, and the LWJGL jars are pre-built 3.3.0 directly from lwjgl.org

Head on over to the [releases](https://github.com/ezfe/m1craft/releases) page to download.

Note: 1.16 and earlier are not supported at this time, but may come later. If you would like to play 1.16 natively on Apple Silicon and have not yet found a way to do so, send me a message and I will investigate this.

Note: 1.18-pre2 and later can be run directly from the official Minecraft launcher. Follow instructions [here](https://gist.github.com/ezfe/8bc43a65e16b79c955f81b4d7fa4ae6a) if you'd prefer to do this instead â€“ including if you need to mod the game. However this launcher is still easier (no install steps needed).
